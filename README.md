# Academic Template 

This repository is meant for those academics who want a base template for their
academic website. It is a Bootstrap template, so better refer the [documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/) for changing the style.

This project is meant to directly clone in your servers' `public_html` folder, since it has all
the dependencies.

## Live demo

I have used this style for my [personal webpage](http://gac.udc.es/~marcos.horro/)

## Basic changes

* Colors: css/custom.css
* Structure: index.html
* Pictures: img/ folder

## License

MIT License. Publications sections uses
[bib-publication-list](https://github.com/vkaravir/bib-publication-list)
project for displaying a graph with all the publications.
